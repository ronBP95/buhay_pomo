## **Roadmap**

<br>

1. Upcoming Widgets: To-do, Fortune (Will use HTTP Requests to call on Fortune API)
2. Creating an active animation for widgets
3. Adding additional functionality to widget menus

Possible Features:

- Volume Control was added to mimic the LifeAt Spaces application but it may or may not be implemented.
- The Sign Up button can have functionality in the future once a remote database is setup and a basic authenticator is built out.
- Menu button will have additional functionality and settings once the volume control, auth, and database have been created.
